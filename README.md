# Design and Implementation of a Peanut Butter Vector Display (PBVD)

This repository contains the documentation, code, and bill of materials (BOM) necessary to create a luminous display using peanut butter as a cost-effective and renewable display material.

I am in the process of moving all documentation into the 

# [PBVD Wiki](https://github.com/scottvr/PBVD/wiki)

[Wiki - BOM](https://github.com/scottvr/PBVD/wiki/BOM)

## Arduino Code

The Arduino sketch for controlling the PBVD is included in the `code` directory. The sketch controls the x/y movement of the laser and the activation of the laser module.

## Assembly Instructions

Have moved to the wiki. 

## Future Exploration

As an exercise for the reader, we propose an investigation into the luminosity-to-dollar ratio among various consumer brands of peanut butter, including a comparison with the NIST Standard Reference Material 2387. This analysis involves measuring the luminous intensity, calculating the cost per unit weight, and determining the luminosity per dollar for each brand.
