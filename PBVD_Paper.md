# Design and Implementation of a Peanut Butter Vector Display (PBVD)
## Abstract
This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel display technology utilizing the phosphorescent properties of peanut butter. The Peanut Butter Vector Display (PBVD) leverages a 200mW 405nm diode laser module to create visible images within a plane of peanut butter injected into a precision-engineered plexiglass frame. This technology aims to revolutionize display systems with an edible, affordable, and visually captivating medium.

## Introduction
The PBVD represents a groundbreaking advancement in display technology, harnessing the unique photophysical properties of peanut butter. This system capitalizes on the phenomenon where peanut butter exhibits a temporary luminescence when exposed to blue or ultraviolet light, likely due to a combination of phosphorescence from phenolic compounds and delayed luminescence from lipid structures. This paper outlines the design considerations, construction methodology, and operational principles of the PBVD, providing a comprehensive guide for replication and further development.

## Technical Background
### Photophysical Properties of Peanut Butter
Peanut butter, a complex colloidal system composed primarily of proteins, lipids, and phenolic compounds, has been observed to exhibit short-lived luminescence under specific wavelengths of light. The primary mechanisms believed to contribute to this phenomenon are:
- Phosphorescence of Phenolic Compounds: 
Phenolic compounds, such as those found in peanut butter, can exhibit phosphorescence, a type of photoluminescence related to the emission of light from a substance that has absorbed photons.
- Delayed Luminescence of Lipids: Certain lipid structures within peanut butter may exhibit delayed luminescence, a phenomenon where absorbed energy is re-emitted over a prolonged period.

## Design Considerations
### Frame Construction
The PBVD utilizes a plexiglass frame engineered to maintain structural integrity while allowing for precise injection and containment of peanut butter. The frame dimensions are optimized for laser scanning efficiency and image stability. Key features include:
### Injection Port 
Allows for uniform distribution of peanut butter across the display plane.
### Sealing Mechanism 
Ensures containment of peanut butter and prevents leakage, maintaining consistent optical properties.
### Laser Module
A 200mW 405nm diode laser module is employed to induce luminescence in the peanut butter. The choice of wavelength (405nm) corresponds to the optimal excitation spectrum for the luminescent compounds within peanut butter. 
Key specifications include:
- Power Output: 200mW, providing sufficient energy for visible luminescence without causing thermal degradation of the medium.
- Beam Divergence: Optimized for precise vector scanning over the display plane.
### Mechanical Yoke System
The laser module is mounted on an x/y mechanical yoke system, enabling precise control over the laserâ€™s position. The yoke system features:
### Stepper Motors 
Provide high-resolution control for accurate laser positioning.
### Control Interface 
Microcontroller-based system for real-time adjustment of laser trajectory based on input vector data.

## Implementation
### Assembly Procedure
- Frame Assembly: Construct the plexiglass frame and ensure all sealing mechanisms are properly installed.
- Peanut Butter Injection: Inject peanut butter into the frame via the injection port, ensuring an even and air-bubble-free distribution.
- Laser Alignment: Mount the laser module onto the mechanical yoke system and calibrate for optimal focus and alignment with the display plane.
- System Integration: Connect the stepper motors and control interface, and perform system checks to ensure synchronized operation.
### Operational Protocol
- Initialization: Power on the control interface and initialize the stepper motors to the home position.
- Vector Input: Load the desired vector data into the control system.
- Laser Activation: Activate the laser module and begin vector scanning. The laser will induce luminescence in the peanut butter along the defined vectors, creating a visible image.
- Image Stabilization: Adjust scanning parameters as necessary to optimize image stability and brightness.

## Conclusion
The Peanut Butter Vector Display (PBVD) demonstrates a novel approach to display technology, combining the unique luminescent properties of peanut butter with precise laser control. This innovative system opens new avenues for edible displays and serves as a testament to the potential of unconventional materials in technological applications. 
Further research and development could explore additional edible mediums and enhance system integration for broader applications.
